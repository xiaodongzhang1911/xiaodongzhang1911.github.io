Ralph J. Slutz, 88, a physicist and computer pioneer who made
critical contributions in two milestones of the human computing history,
passed away on November 16, 2005, at Boulder Community Hospital, Colorado, USA.
Dr. Slutz was among the first four principal engineers working with
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann>
John von Neumann</a>
to build a computer with a central memory to store and modify
data and instructions
(the well-known <a href=https://www.ias.edu/electronic-computer-project>
Electronic Computer Project</a>,
also called the IAS computer)
at the <a href=http://www.ias.edu/>Institute for Advanced
Study</a> (1946-1948), in Princeton, New Jersey. He later became the chief architect working
with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_N._Alexander>Samuel N. Alexander</a>, Director of the Electronic Computer Laboratory
of the National Bureau of
Standards (the <a href=http://www.nist.gov/index.html> NIST</a> now),
to build the <a href=https://www.nist.gov/node/774361> SEAC Computer</a>,
which was the first computer with an internally stored program in
the US government, and the first operational machine of this kind in the US (1948-1950).
<p>

Ralph J. Slutz was born in Cleveland, Ohio on May 18, 1917. He received his Bachelor's Degree
and Master's Degree in
Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1938 and 1939 respectively.

<hr>
In the summer of 1938, the young Slutz made a brave cross-country bicycle trip with simple and light luggage.
He started his journey from Cambridge, Massachusetts on the East Coast,
and arrived in Oregon, West Coast, and then
rode back to MIT on the East Coast. The bicycle trip originally started with
three MIT students: Ralph, John Mitchell whose sister Margaret later
married with Ralph,
and William "Bosco" Burdett. Bosco only rode for a few days. John returned
home after crossing part of Canada and reaching Michigan's upper peninsula.
In this trip, Ralph endured tremendous hardships and overcame
many difficulties.
According to Ralph, this long and challenging bicycle journey really tempered his willpower so that
he later became more determined and patient.

<hr>
In 1939, Ralph left MIT for Princeton University
to work towards his Ph.D. in Physics. During World War II, Ralph stopped
his dissertation research to join national defense projects. He served in the Office of Scientific Research and
Development, attached to the 8th Air Force, from 1943 to 1945. He received his Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics
in 1946 from Princeton University. In the same year, he married
<a href=https://xiaodongzhang1911.github.io/Slutz-papers/Margaret-Slutz.pdf> Margaret Mary Mitchell</a> (1919-2011) in June.
<p>

<hr>
The completion of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC> ENIAC</a> computer in 1945
represented an important milestone in human computing history. However, the
original ENIAC machine only had computation capability, without a central memory to store programs and data.
In June 1945, John von Neumann published a paper entitled <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC>``First draft of a report to the EDVAC"</a>, where
he outlined three basic components for a stored-program computer: (1) a memory containing both data and instructions; (2)
a calculating unit capable of performing both arithmetic and logical operations on the data, and (3) a control unit to interpret
instructions stored in memory and make necessary actions. This is the so called ``von Neumann model" that lays an important
foundation for modern computer architecture design. von Neumann started the Electronic Computer Project to turn this model
into a reality at the Institute for Advanced
Study in late 1945. He first invited <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Goldstine> Herman H. Goldstine</a> (1913-2004)
who played a key role in the development of ENIAC, to join the project as the
chief architect in 1946. One of the first four principal engineers von Neumann and Goldstine hired was Ralph Slutz who was a
fresh Princeton University Ph.D. of 29 years old. The other three were
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bigelow> Julian Bigelow</a>
(1913-2003), <a href=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_H._Pomerene>
James H. Pomerene</a> (1920-2008), and
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Ware> Willis H. Ware</a> (1920-2013).
<p>
Julian Bigelow in his article of "Computer Development at the Institute for
Advanced Study" (a chapter in the book of
<a href=http://www.amazon.com/History-Computing-Twentieth-Nicholas-Metropolis/dp/0124916503>
<i>A History of Computing in the
Twentieth Century</i></a>, 1980) had the following decription about the initial
team of the von Neumann's computer project:
<p>

<i> When I got to Princeton in June 1946, three engineers had already been
employed without any knowledge or contact on my part, and two were on the
way. In fact, they turned out to be excellent choices, and I should particularly
like to mention James Pomerene, who is now an IBM Fellow, Ralph Slutz, who had
recently finished his Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton and is now with
the Bureau of Standards at Boulder, and Willis Ware, who is now with the Rand
Corporation at Santa Monica.
</i>

<p>

Willis Ware
in his 1953 RAND Report of <a href=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2010/P377.pdf> "The History and Development of the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study" </a>,
had the same acknowledgment to the initial
team of the von Neumann's computer project:
<p>

<i>  At Princeton, Julian Bigelow, who was chief engineer of the original group, now holds a permanent appointment to the Institute and acts in a consulting capacity to the computer project; Jim Pomerene, one of the original staff, has remained at Princeton and is now in charge of the engineering. Willis Ware, another of the original staff, is now at RAND. Another original, Ralph Slutz, has been with the Bureau of Standards for several years, and had a large responsibility for the SEAC machine.

Ralph had two productive years working in the IAS Computer project from 1946 to 1948. He was actively involved in several innovations of advanced computer architecture technologies of CPU and memory storage.
He and <a href=http://www.rcaselectron.com/snyder.html> Rrichard Snyder</a>
(1911-1996) also had an invention on "Static Megnetic Memories".
In <a href=https://xiaodongzhang1911.github.io/Slutz-papers/Snyder-letter-1953.pdf>
the letter to Dr. Robert Oppenheimer</a> who was the IAS
Director then, Richard Snyder and Ralph suggested that their invention be
open to the public. In
<a href=https://xiaodongzhang1911.github.io/Slutz-papers/Oppenheimer-reply-1953.pdf>
the reply letter </a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer> Dr. Oppenheimer </a> stated that he and Professor
Von Neumann had agreed "that in as much as all the work that was done on the
computer was placed in the public domain". This may be a starting point of
the "open source" concept
in the early stage of the computing field.

Here is a paper co-authored by the four principal engineers,
Bigelow, Pomerene, Slutz, and Ware, entitled <a href=https://xiaodongzhang1911.github.io/Slutz-papers/ias-report-1947.pdf>``On the physical
realization of an electronic computing instrument"</a>, where detailed hardware implementations of this stored-program machine were
presented. (only the cover-page is linked here).

This picture was taken by Willis Ware during Christmas, 1947. According to Willis Ware, a group of IAS Computer Project people
sang Christmas carols in front of the house of <a href=http://www.westegg.com/einstein/>Albert Einstein</a>
(1879-1955) on Christmas eve. Einstein and his housekeeper
came to the front door to recognize and greet these young singers. From left:

<p>
The reason why Ralph left the Institute for Advanced Study's Computer Project
after only
two years besides the
opportunity to build
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAC_(computer)> SEAC</a> in NBS
was little known. He
seemed to avoid mentioning about it during his lifetime. According to
the
<a href=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/fa_comporalhist_index.aspx>
Computer Oral History Collection</a> archived by Lemelson Center for the
Study of Invention and Innovation in the Smithsonian National
Museum of American History, Ralph had different technical opinions from
Von Neumann and Jilian Bigelow on the selection of memory models.
<a href=https://www.computer.org/profiles/morris-rubinoff> Morris Rubinoff</a> (1917-2003), another computer pioneer,
made the following comments in his recollections of the Institute for
Advanced Study history:
<p>
<i> At that time Ralph Slutz was arguing that in spite of the fact that
Von Neumann thought it ought to be implemented on an asynchronous parallel
basis that's not the way technology will allow systems to be built. And Ralph
Slutz and Julian Bigelow debated this question</i>.
<p>

Von Neumann and Bigelow proposed to use the Selectron Tube that was an early
form of digital computer memory developed by
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_A._Rajchman>Jan A. Rajchman</a>
and his group
at the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). Jan Rajchman indicated that he
could make an asynchronous parallel type memory via Slectron. The development
of Selectron Tube for the Computer Project started in 1946 under the order of
Von Neumann with a planned production by the end of the year. However,
the Selectron Tube based on asynchronous parallel memory could not be
produced after two years. By that time, the Computer Project in the
Institute for Advanced Study was forced to switch to
the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube>Williams tube</a> for storage that was developed in 1947.
RCA eventually gave up the concept of asynchronous parallel type memory.
<p>

This early part of the history in the Computer Project witnessed that Ralph's
argument was
right. His SEAC machine successfully adopted the Williams tube before
the Institute for Advanced Study machine did. He objectively argued and challenged the decision
made by the top
authority with his technical basis, which reflected his meticulous
scholarships started from his early career. Morris Robinoff
gave the following comments on Ralph's leaving from the Institute for Advanced
Study to NBS:

<p>
<i> The early history is that Ralph Slutz did go to the National Bureau of
Standards and designed and built SEAC which was done in something like 18
months and running at that time. It was vacuum tubes with transformer coupling
and diod switching and megnetic wire input-output. Those are key items.</i>
<p>

<hr>
<p>
In 1948, Ralph left the Institute for Advanced Study,
and became the chief architect with
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_N._Alexander> Samuel N.
Alexander</a> (1909-1967) to build the SEAC computer for the National
Bureau of Standards
(Standards Eastern Automatic Computer) in Washington DC. The SEAC machine, completed in
1950, was the first computer in the US government with an internally stored program,
and the first operational computer of this kind in the US.
Besides new techniques in memory systems, SEAC also originally introduced several innovations that were
later adopted in modern computers: (1) I/O mechanisms for data processing,
(2) time-sharing (running multiple programs in the computer concurrently),
(3) the interconnection of two computers in 1954 for data communication,
and (4) a graphical display. Ralph's paper entitled ``Memories of Bureau
of Standards SEAC" has become
an important part of the historical record of human computing.
Ralph received a Silver Medal for the Exceptional Service in the Design of
the SEAC Computer by the US Department of Commerce
in 1951.

<i>A History of Computing in the
Twentieth Century</i></a> in 1980,
Ralph Slutz
wrote, ``At this point I should like particularly to remember Sam Alexander, who was the moving
spirit in the Bureau's hardware work on computers, and who should be writing this
paper if he were still alive. he always treated me more like a son than an employee, and we
had a warm and productive relationship."

Oral history interview of Ralph Slutz</a> in June 1976, in which
Ralph talked about his experiences of building the two early computers in late
1940s and early 1950s.

<hr>
<p>
In 1954, Ralph Slutz was appointed as Chief of
the Radio Propagation Physics Division, leading research and
development of time and frequency using radio broadcasts, in the
newly established NBS Boulder Laboratories (note: his Lab is called
the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory). He left Washington DC in 1954,
and had lived in Boulder, Colorado, since then until he passed away in
November 2005. He played an important leadership role in research of
time and frequency that pioneered atomic clocks, and disseminated
time and frequency by radio broadcast. Ralph served in the Science Advisory
Committee for both President Harry Truman and President Dwight Eisenhower
in 1950's.
During this period, Ralph mainly focused on his research in the area of
radio electronics with his strong physics background. As a
guest physicist, he also
spent a year conducting research in the Max-Planck Institute in Munich,
Germany, in the academic year of 1960 to 1961.
<p>

  As soon as Ralph came to Boulder in 1954, he was named as professor adjunct,
and taught a class called "Computer Solutions
to Engineering Problems" at the Electrical
Engineering Department in the University of Colorado at Boulder.
This was probably the first computer related
class offered in University of Colorado when there were only several
highly expensive and giant computers
available in the world.

<hr>
In 1980, after his 32 years of distinguished career as a scientist and leader in the National Bureau of Standards, Ralph retired from his government
position. He then joined <a href=http://cires.colorado.edu/> Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)</a> in the
<a href=http://www.colorado.edu> University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, as a senior scientist. He also remained his professor adjunct appointment
in the <a href=https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/> Electrical Engineering Department</a> at CU Boulder. He became a major architect and leader
of a well-known and visionary project to create a <a href=http://icoads.noaa.gov/>Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)<a>  that would be
shared by scientists all over the world. This huge scientific database has had a significant and continuous impact in helping scientists better understand and predict
our ocean and atmosphere behavior by studying the historical data collected all over the world since 1854. Ralph was a lead author of the original paper of COADS,
entitled <a href=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281987%29068%3C1239%3AACOADS%3E2.0.CO%3B2> "A comprehensive ocean-atmosphere data
set"</a>, published in <i> Bulletin of American Meteorological Society</i>
in 1987. (Note: the COADS project was originally launched by
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_O._Fletcher> Joe Fletcher</a>
(1920-2008), who was a well respected climate scientist and a
distinguised leader. He
led an US Air Force exploring aircraft (C-47) to land on
the North Pole in 1952, which was the first time in human history).

<p>

Between 1983 to 1985, Ralph hired <a href=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang> Xiaodong Zhang</a> as his <a href=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang/Slutz-RA-offer.pdf> research assistant</a> in the COADS project. Xiaodong
was a fresh college graduate from China then, and was a graduate student of <a href=http://www.cs.colorado.edu> Computer Science</a>
in the University of Colorado at Boulder. Xiaodong spent two
``privileged" years closely working with a world-class scholar, which had a huge impact on his later life and his career in the US. Xiaodong was Ralph's only
formal student under his supervision in his life.
The mentorship and friendship between Ralph and Xiaodong had lasted more than 20 years.
Directed by Ralph, Xiaodong completed his Master thesis on <a href=http://libraries.colorado.edu/search/l?SEARCH=T+1985+.Z61>
An approach to a portable data compression system</a> in the Spring of 1985. The data compression techniques proposed in this thesis have been used in the COADS database.

<p>
Invited by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 1985 summer, Ralph and his assistant Xiaodong took a three month trip to China to
distribute an early version of COADS database, and to give a series of lectures on its numerical methods and the software system.
Xiaodong was also Ralph's translator
for all of his lectures at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National
Ocean Administration, and several other universities.
Both of them did much hands-on
system work to help Chinese colleagues access the database and use the
software for scientific research.

<h3><b>Acknowledgment</b></h3>
<p>

With the highest respect to Ralph Slutz, I made this Web page as a memorial to him. I am grateful to <a href=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang/Margaret-Slutz.pdf> Margaret Slutz</a> (1919-2011), Ralph's wife, for her care and help
when I first came to US, and for her many years' friendship. I appreciate
Karen,
Rob, Eric, and Don, (Ralph's four children) for providing me with the historical documents about Ralph. Eric Slutz provided high quality technical
support for these pictures. I would like to thank Dr. Willis Ware, Ralph's
colleague on the Instutute for Advanced Study's Computer Project,
who is another computer pioneer, for his advice and many e-mail communications. Finally, I would like to acknowledge
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dyson_(science_historian)>George Dyson</a> whom I first met in the <a href=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix05/tech/> USENIX ATC 2005 conference </a> after his keynote speech. George is a historian of computer pioneers and grew up in
Princeton University. He has given me valuable suggestions and
